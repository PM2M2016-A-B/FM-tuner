# Fm tuner (si4703)

FM-tuner is a server working on BeagleBoard. It uses the [si4703 tuner] (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12938) to listen radio stations, and transmits RDS data to clients as well as information of the volume or the current channel. 

It works on the principle of subscription, It only transmits different data to each message. Consequently two successive messages cannot contain the same data.

__Example__: The following RDS message: `FLASH_FM` is parsed by the service, it is broadcasted to the possible clients. If, it is again parsed by the service, it is not returned.
